General Explanation
The objective of the game is to eliminate all enemies before the player runs out of health. The player navigates a board, battles enemies, and interacts with various objects.
In this game:
* The player has a primary weapon that shoots balls and a special weapon that charges over time and shoots a bomb.
* There are two types of enemies with different behaviors:
   * Small and fast enemies.
   * Big and slow enemies.
* The game includes various obstacles such as trees and walls that block movement, as well as power-ups that enhance the player's abilities.
* The play area shrinks over time due to encroaching poison, adding an additional layer of challenge


Design
Objects and Their Responsibilities
1. BaseObject: The base class for all objects in the game.
   * MovingObject: Inherits from BaseObject, represents objects that can move.
      * PlayerObject: Represents the player character. Manages player movement, shooting, and interactions.
      * BaseEnemyObject: Base class for all enemy characters.
         * BigSlowEnemyObject: Represents a large, slow-moving enemy.
         * SmallFastEnemyObject: Represents a small, fast-moving enemy.
      * BulletObject: Base class for all bullets fired by weapons.
         * BallObject: Represents a ball bullet.
         * BombObject: Represents a bomb bullet.
         * LaserObject: Represents a laser bullet.
   * StaticObject: Inherits from BaseObject, represents objects that do not move.
      * TreeObject: Represents a tree that blocks movement.
      * WallObject: Represents a wall that blocks movement.
      * BaseGiftObject: Base class for all gifts/power-ups.
         * FreezeGiftObject: Freezes enemies temporarily.
         * LifeGiftObject: Increases player health.

2. FlashlightObject: A member of PlayerObject. Represents the area where the player can shoot. Follows the mouse cursor and is always visible on the screen.
3. BaseWeaponObject: Base class for weapons, responsible for creating and firing bullets.
   * EnemyWeaponObject: Represents weapons used by enemies.
   * PlayerWeaponObject: Represents weapons used by the player.
4. GameState: Base class for different game states, managed by Controller.
   * MenuState: Represents the main menu.
   * PauseState: Represents the pause menu.
   * PlayState: Represents the main gameplay.
   * LooseState: Represents the state when the player loses.
   * WinState: Represents the state when the player wins.
   * InstructionsState: Represents the instructions screen.
Interaction Between Objects
* PlayerObject interacts with MovingObject and StaticObject for movement and collision detection.
* BulletObject interacts with enemies and static objects to determine hits and effects.
* Board manages all objects, loading levels, and updating game states.
* GameState and Controller manage transitions between different screens and states.
* HandlingCollision handles all collision logic between different types of objects.
